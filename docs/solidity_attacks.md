The following are attacks specific to the Solidity Runtime

## DoS with (Unexpected) revert

Consider a simple auction contract:

```sol
// INSECURE
contract Auction {
    address currentLeader;
    uint highestBid;

    function bid() payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid);

        require(currentLeader.send(highestBid)); // Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert

        currentLeader = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }
}
```

When it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will *always* fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the `bid()` function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a [pull payment system](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/#favor-pull-over-push-payments) instead, as described earlier.

Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.


```sol
address[] private refundAddresses;
mapping (address => uint) public refunds;

// bad
function refundAll() public {
    for(uint x; x < refundAddresses.length; x++) { // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated
        require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]])) // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds
    }
}
```

Again, the recommended solution is to [favor pull over push payments](#favor-pull-over-push-payments).

## Integer Overflow and Underflow

Be aware there are around [20 cases for overflow and underflow](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796#issuecomment-253578925).

Consider a simple token transfer:

```sol
mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

// INSECURE
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    /* Check if sender has balance */
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
    /* Add and subtract new balances */
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
}

// SECURE
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    /* Check if sender has balance and for overflows */
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value && balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]);

    /* Add and subtract new balances */
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
}
```

If a balance reaches the maximum uint value (2^256) it will circle back to zero. This checks for that condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the uint value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.

The same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.

Be careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.

Be aware there are around [20 cases for overflow and underflow](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796#issuecomment-253578925).

## Forcibly Sending Ether to a Contract

It is possible to forcibly send Ether to a contract without triggering its fallback function. This is an important consideration when placing important logic in the fallback function or making calculations based on a contract's balance. Take the following example:

```sol
contract Vulnerable {
    function () payable {
        revert();
    }

    function somethingBad() {
        require(this.balance > 0);
        // Do something bad
    }
}
```

Contract logic seems to disallow payments to the contract and therefore disallow "something bad" from happening. However, a few methods exist for forcibly sending ether to the contract and therefore making its balance greater than zero.

The `selfdestruct` contract method allows a user to specify a beneficiary to send any excess ether. `selfdestruct` [does not trigger a contract's fallback function](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether).

It is also possible to [precompute](https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/ricmoo) a contract's address and send Ether to that address before deploying the contract.

Contract developers should be aware that Ether can be forcibly sent to a contract and should design contract logic accordingly. Generally, assume that it is not possible to restrict sources of funding to your contract.
