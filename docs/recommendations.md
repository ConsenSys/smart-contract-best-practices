# Protocol Security Recommendations

The following are a number of protocol patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.

## External Calls

### Don't make control flow assumptions after external calls

Whether using *raw calls* (of the form `someAddress.call()`) or *contract calls* (of the form `ExternalContract.someMethod()`), assume that malicious code will execute unless the untrusted. Even if `ExternalContract` is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts *it* calls.

One particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to race conditions. (See [Race Conditions](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/#race-conditions) for a fuller discussion of this problem).

If you are making a call to an untrusted external contract, *avoid state changes after the call*.

### Handle errors in external calls

Solidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: `address.call()`, `address.callcode()`, `address.delegatecall()`, and `address.send()`. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return `false` if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, *contract calls* (e.g., `ExternalContract.doSomething()`) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, `ExternalContract.doSomething()` will also `throw` if `doSomething()` throws).

If you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.

```sol
// bad
someAddress.send(55);
someAddress.call.value(55)(); // this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result
someAddress.call.value(100)(bytes4(sha3("deposit()"))); // if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted

// good
if(!someAddress.send(55)) {
    // Some failure code
}

ExternalContract(someAddress).deposit.value(100);
```


### Favor *pull* over *push* for external calls

External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of [problems with the gas limit](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/#dos-with-block-gas-limit).)  Avoid combining multiple `send()` calls in a single transaction.

```sol
// bad
contract auction {
    address highestBidder;
    uint highestBid;

    function bid() payable {
        require(msg.value >= highestBid);

        if (highestBidder != 0) {
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); // if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid
        }

       highestBidder = msg.sender;
       highestBid = msg.value;
    }
}

// good
contract auction {
    address highestBidder;
    uint highestBid;
    mapping(address => uint) refunds;

    function bid() payable external {
        require(msg.value >= highestBid);

        if (highestBidder != 0) {
            refunds[highestBidder] += highestBid; // record the refund that this user can claim
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawRefund() external {
        uint refund = refunds[msg.sender];
        refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(refund);
    }
}
```

## Don't assume contracts are created with zero balance

An attacker can send wei to the address of a contract before it is created.  Contracts should not assume that its initial state contains a zero balance.  See [issue 61](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/issues/61) for more details.

## Remember that on-chain data is public

Many applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid second-price auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, take care to avoid requiring users to publish information too early.

Examples:

* In rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.
* In an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.
* When developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through http://btcrelay.org), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to "commit" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and [RANDAO](http://github.com/randao/randao).
* If you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.

## In 2-party or N-party contracts, beware of the possibility that some participants may "drop offline" and not return

Do not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can "grief" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.

# Solidity Recommendations

The following are a number of solidity patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.

## Keep fallback functions simple

[Fallback functions](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#fallback-function) are called when a contract is sent a message with no arguments (or when no function matches), and only has access to 2,300 gas when called from a `.send()` or `.transfer()`. If you wish to be able to receive Ether from a `.send()` or `.transfer()`, the most you can do in a fallback function is log an event. Use a proper function if a computation or more gas is required.

```sol
// bad
function() payable { balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; }

// good
function deposit() payable external { balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; }

function() payable { LogDepositReceived(msg.sender); }
```

## Explicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables

Explicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being `external`, `public`, `internal` or `private`. Please understand the differences between them, for example, `external` may be sufficient instead of `public`. For state variables, `external` is not possible. Labeling the visibility explicitly will make it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can call the function or access the variable.

```sol
// bad
uint x; // the default is private for state variables, but it should be made explicit
function buy() { // the default is public
    // public code
}

// good
uint private y;
function buy() external {
    // only callable externally
}

function utility() public {
    // callable externally, as well as internally: changing this code requires thinking about both cases.
}

function internalAction() internal {
    // internal code
}
```

## Lock pragmas to specific compiler version

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested the most with. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs. Contracts may also be deployed by others and the pragma indicates the compiler version intended by the original authors.

```sol
// bad
pragma solidity ^0.4.4;


// good
pragma solidity 0.4.4;
```

## Differentiate functions and events

Favor capitalization and a prefix in front of events (we suggest *Log*), to prevent the risk of confusion between functions and events. For functions, always start with a lowercase letter, except for the constructor.

```sol
// bad
event Transfer() {}
function transfer() {}

// good
event LogTransfer() {}
function transfer() external {}
```

## Prefer newer Solidity constructs

Prefer constructs/aliases such as `selfdestruct` (over `suicide`) and `keccak256` (over `sha3`).  Patterns like `require(msg.sender.send(1 ether))` can also be simplified to using `transfer()`, as in `msg.sender.transfer(1 ether)`.

## Be aware that 'Built-ins' can be shadowed

It is currently possible to [shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing) built-in globals in Solidity. This allows contracts to override the functionality of built-ins such as `msg` and `revert()`. Although this [is intended](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1249), it can mislead users of a contract as to the contract's true behavior.

```sol
contract PretendingToRevert {
    function revert() internal constant {}
}

contract ExampleContract is PretendingToRevert {
    function somethingBad() public {
        revert();
    }
}
```

Contract users (and auditors) should be aware of the full smart contract source code of any application they intend to use.

## Avoid using `tx.origin`

Never use `tx.origin` for authorization, another contract can have a method which will call your contract (where the user has some funds for instance) and your contract will authorize that transaction as your address is in `tx.origin`.

```
pragma solidity 0.4.18;

contract MyContract {

    address owner;

    function MyContract() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function sendTo(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(tx.origin == owner);
        receiver.transfer(amount);
    }

}

contract AttackingContract {

    MyContract myContract;
    address attacker;

    function AttackingContract(address myContractAddress) public {
        myContract = MyContract(myContractAddress);
        attacker = msg.sender;
    }

    function() public {
        myContract.sendTo(attacker, msg.sender.balance);
    }

}
```

You should use `msg.sender` for authorization (if another contract calls your contract `msg.sender` will be the address of the contract and not the address of the user who called the contract).

You can read more about it here: [Solidity docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#tx-origin)

Besides the issue with authorization, there is a chance that `tx.origin` will be removed from the Ethereum protocol in the future, so code that uses `tx.origin` won't be compatible with future releases [Vitalik: 'Do NOT assume that tx.origin will continue to be usable or meaningful.'](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/196/how-do-i-make-my-dapp-serenity-proof/200#200)

It's also worth mentioning that by using `tx.origin` you're limiting interoperability between contracts because the contract that uses tx.origin cannot be used by another contract as a contract can't be the `tx.origin`.

## Deprecated/historical recommendations

These are recommendations which are no longer relevant due to changes in the protocol or improvements to solidity. They are recorded here for posterity and awareness.

### Beware division by zero (Solidity < 0.4)

Prior to version 0.4, Solidity [returns zero](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/670) and does not `throw` an exception when a number is divided by zero. Ensure you're running at least version 0.4.
