This page demonstrates a number of protocol patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.

## External Calls

### Don't make control flow assumptions after external calls

Whether using *raw calls* (of the form `someAddress.call()`) or *contract calls* (of the form `ExternalContract.someMethod()`), assume that malicious code will execute unless the untrusted. Even if `ExternalContract` is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts *it* calls.

One particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to race conditions. (See [Race Conditions](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/#race-conditions) for a fuller discussion of this problem).

If you are making a call to an untrusted external contract, *avoid state changes after the call*.

### Handle errors in external calls

Solidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: `address.call()`, `address.callcode()`, `address.delegatecall()`, and `address.send()`. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return `false` if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, *contract calls* (e.g., `ExternalContract.doSomething()`) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, `ExternalContract.doSomething()` will also `throw` if `doSomething()` throws).

If you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.

```sol
// bad
someAddress.send(55);
someAddress.call.value(55)(); // this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result
someAddress.call.value(100)(bytes4(sha3("deposit()"))); // if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted

// good
if(!someAddress.send(55)) {
    // Some failure code
}

ExternalContract(someAddress).deposit.value(100);
```


### Favor *pull* over *push* for external calls

External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of [problems with the gas limit](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/#dos-with-block-gas-limit).)  Avoid combining multiple `send()` calls in a single transaction.

```sol
// bad
contract auction {
    address highestBidder;
    uint highestBid;

    function bid() payable {
        require(msg.value >= highestBid);

        if (highestBidder != 0) {
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); // if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid
        }

       highestBidder = msg.sender;
       highestBid = msg.value;
    }
}

// good
contract auction {
    address highestBidder;
    uint highestBid;
    mapping(address => uint) refunds;

    function bid() payable external {
        require(msg.value >= highestBid);

        if (highestBidder != 0) {
            refunds[highestBidder] += highestBid; // record the refund that this user can claim
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawRefund() external {
        uint refund = refunds[msg.sender];
        refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(refund);
    }
}
```

## Don't assume contracts are created with zero balance

An attacker can send wei to the address of a contract before it is created.  Contracts should not assume that its initial state contains a zero balance.  See [issue 61](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices/issues/61) for more details.

## Remember that on-chain data is public

Many applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid second-price auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, take care to avoid requiring users to publish information too early.

Examples:

* In rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.
* In an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.
* When developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through http://btcrelay.org), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to "commit" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and [RANDAO](http://github.com/randao/randao).
* If you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.

## In 2-party or N-party contracts, beware of the possibility that some participants may "drop offline" and not return

Do not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can "grief" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.
